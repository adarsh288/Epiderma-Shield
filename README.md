<h3 align="center">A deep learning-based skin disease detection project.</h3>

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for skin disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on labeled skin image data using TensorFlow and Keras, covering dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. The project demonstrates practical experience in applying computer vision techniques to a healthcare-related classification problem.
