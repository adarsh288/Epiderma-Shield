## Objective
The primary objective of this project, Epiderma Shield, is to develop a reliable and accessible AI-based solution for the detection and classification of common skin diseases, alopecia and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). By leveraging the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to bridge the gap between modern dermatological diagnostics and the limitations of real-world clinical accessibility, especially in resource-constrained environments.

## Dataset Description
The model is trained on a dataset of dermatological images sourced from Kaggle (Shubham Goel's Dermnet dataset). This publicly available Dermnet Dataset on Kaggle has been widely used as a benchmark for skin disease classification tasks. The dataset consists of 644 high-resolution, labelled skin disease images, which serve as a valuable resource for training and validating deep learning models. It includes a variety of disease categories, including alopecia and herpes, making it relevant to our project.

## Modeling Approach
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented for skin disease image classification. The model automatically learns visual features such as color, texture, and patterns from input images. Convolutional and dense layers were used to extract meaningful representations and predict disease categories through supervised learning.
